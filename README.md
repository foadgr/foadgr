### üöÄ Recent Project: 
#### Chat with OpenTargets (7/20/2023)

A recent project, "Chat with OpenTargets," uses a GPT-3.5 model that facilitates a conversation with OpenTargets for genetic and clinical insights. 

Check out the [project repository](https://github.com/foadgr/chatGPT-for-genetics) and see it in action in this [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAf7GuBpOAU) ![demo video](/resources/chatwithopentargets.gif).

### üí° My Interests

My work in healthcare informatics involves leveraging predictive methods to extract key medical concepts, classify health conditions, and forecast disease progression.

Here are some of my recent conference presentations:
