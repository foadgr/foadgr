## 👋 Hi there, I'm Foad (@foadgr)

I'm a Senior Data Scientist with over 5 years of professional experience, specializing in machine learning, natural language processing, and data-driven product decision-making. 

### 📚 My Recent Work

I have a proven track record of applying advanced data science methods in healthcare and finance, transforming data insights into strategic product decisions. My work in healthcare involves leveraging NLP and machine learning techniques to extract key medical concepts, classify health conditions, and forecast disease progression. I have presented my research findings at international conferences, including AMIA ([1](https://syapse.com/uploads/downloads/Transformer-Based-Embedding-AMIA-2023-1.pdf?utm_content=241371577&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-336564)), ISPOR ([1](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2023-3665/126328), [2](https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/intl2023-3666/126852)), and ASCO ([1](https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/219665?0=n&1=u&2=l&3=l), [2](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.1550?af=R)). In finance, I've focused on areas such as volatility prediction and macroeconomic analysis.

However, my interests and capabilities extend beyond these domains. I am always excited to explore new opportunities where my skills can make a significant impact.
